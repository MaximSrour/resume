# Resume generator

This project was written to generate a PDF resume based on the content of https://msrour.me

The database is a planetscale DB which stores all of the required information which is normally rendered to the site. This program queries the actual data and then generates a PDF using LaTeX.

This program is written with Python, and is a work in progress.

Run install.sh to install all required dependencies.
